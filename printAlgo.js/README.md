### Given n representing the number of floors build a beautiful multi-million dollar mansions like the ones in the example below:

             /\
            /  \
           /    \
          /______\  number of floors 3
          |      |
          |      |
          |______|

             /\
            /  \
           /____\
           |    |   2 floors
           |____|

             /\
            /__\    1 floor
            |__|

Note: whitespace should be preserved on both sides of the roof.
Number of floors will go up to 30. There will be no tests with invalid input.

Good luck!
